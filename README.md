# odin-caesar-cipher

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-caesar-cipher).
It implements a Caesar cipher function that takes in a string and the shift factor.
It then outputs the modified string using a right shift.
Letter case remains the same after the shift, and symbols are not changed.
